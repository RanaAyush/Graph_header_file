This is the header file for C++ Graph functionalities.

We can use this header file in our code so that we donot have to write code for certain algorithms of graphs include:

  1.BFS
  
  2.DFS
  
  3.Bellman ford distance
  
  4.Dijkstra dist
  
  5.floyd warshall algo
  
  5.shortet path between nodes
  
  6.Minimum spanning tree
  
  7.Topological sort

for both directed and undirected graphs.

steps to use :

1. copy my_header.h and my_implementation.cpp where you want to use these in code. 
2. Then import header file using: 
        #include "my_header.h"
3. you are done u can use all the graph functionalities just by making make Object of Graph 
    and pass edges into it.
4. you can refer run_.cpp to see how we can use the library.
